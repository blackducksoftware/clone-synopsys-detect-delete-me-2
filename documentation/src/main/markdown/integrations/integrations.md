# [solution_name] Integrations

The [solution_name] integrations allow users to install and run [solution_name] in various environments.

[solution_name] is a [blackduck_product_name] intelligent scan client that scans code bases in your projects and folders to perform compositional analysis. [solution_name] sends scan results to [blackduck_product_name], which generates risk analysis when identifying open source components, licenses, and security vulnerabilities.

**Note:** As plugins are independant open source projects, not all will be supported for a particular release of [solution_name] at the time of [solution_name] release.
Please consult the [compatibility matrix](https://synopsys.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/INTDOCS/pages/177799187/Black+Duck+Release+Compatibility) to determine the compatible releases.
