# [solution_name] for Azure DevOps

The [solution_name] for Azure DevOps plugin, formerly known as Black Duck Detect plugin for TFS/VSTS, is architected to seamlessly integrate [solution_name] with Azure DevOps build and release pipelines. [solution_name] makes it easier to set up and scan code bases using a variety of languages and package managers.

The [solution_name] plugin for Azure DevOps supports native scanning in your Azure DevOps environment to run Software Composition Analysis (SCA) on your code.

As a Synopsys and Azure DevOps user, [solution_name] Extension for Azure DevOps enables you to:

- Run a component scan in an Azure DevOps job and create projects and releases in Black Duck through the Azure DevOps job.
- After a scan is complete, the results are available on the [blackduck_product_name] server (for SCA).

Using the [solution_name] Extension for Azure DevOps together with [blackduck_product_name] enables you to use Azure DevOps to automatically create [blackduck_product_name] projects from your Azure DevOps projects.
## Invoking [solution_name]
Synopsys recommends invoking [solution_name] from the CI (build) pipeline.  Scanning during CI enables [solution_name] to break your application build, which is effective for enforcing policies like preventing the use of disallowed or vulnerable components.
