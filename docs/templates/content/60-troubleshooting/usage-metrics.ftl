# Usage metrics collection

${solution_name} uses Google Analytics to collect anonymized usage metrics through a mechanism called *phone home*.
${company_name} uses this data to help set engineering priorities.

In a network where access to outside servers is limited, this mechanism may fail, and those failures
may be visible in the log. This is a harmless failure; ${solution_name} will continue to function
normally.

To disable this mechanism for ${solution_name} runs executed from one environment,
set the environment variable *SYNOPSYS_SKIP_PHONE_HOME* to *true*.
To disable this mechanism for all ${solution_name} runs against a specific ${blackduck_product_name}
server, refer to the ${blackduck_product_name} documentation for information on disabling analytics.
