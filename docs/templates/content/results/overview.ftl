# Viewing and Managing Scan Results

To view and manage your ${solution_name} scan results, do the following tasks.

- In the ${solution_name} output, look for "Detect Result" and copy the Black Duck Project BOM URL as shown in the following example:

````
2020-06-11 06:35:39 INFO [main] ---======== Detect Result ========
2020-06-11 06:35:39 INFO [main] --- Black Duck Project BOM: https://my-hub-docker/api/projects/d8f798f1-1901-4902-aec7-f2e1cf2e4958/versions/6a8938e9-3615-40dd-8386-3bcb4ba52bec/components
````
- Open the ${blackduck_product_name} Project BOM URL in a browser to view the scan results in ${blackduck_product_name}.
- To find your scan in ${blackduck_product_name}, go to your ${blackduck_product_name} instance and click Scans to see a list of scans on the Scans page.

For help with viewing and analyzing your scan results go to the ${blackduck_product_name} Help page navigation menu at https://{Your hub host}/doc/Welcome.htm
