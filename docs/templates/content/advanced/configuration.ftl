# Configuration

${solution_name} behavior is controlled by properties that can be set using various mechanisms provided by
[Spring Boot's configuration mechanism](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html).
${solution_name} users can leverage Spring Boot capabilities beyond command line arguments and environment variables (for example: hierarchy of property files, and placeholders)
to manage properties in more sophisticated ways.
