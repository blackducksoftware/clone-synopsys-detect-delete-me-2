# Components

The components comprise the following:

## Tools

Each Synopsys Detect run consists of running any applicable Synopsys Detect tools.

## Detectors

Synopsys Detect uses detectors to find and extract dependencies from all supported package managers.

## Inspectors

An inspector is typically a plugin that a Synopsys Detect detector uses to access the internal resources of a package manager through its API.
